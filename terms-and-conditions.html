                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.1. Purchase:</strong> Tokens can be purchased directly from us through the Services using the payment methods available, which are processed via our third-party payment processor, Stripe. All transactions are subject to Stripe's terms and conditions and privacy policy. We do not store your full payment card details, only a payment identifier provided by Stripe linked to your transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.2. Purpose:</strong> Tokens are purchased to access Premium Services within the applications, such as generating a Report in the Car Inspector application.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.3. Value:</strong> Tokens represent a license to access Premium Services within the BuiltThis Software ecosystem. They do not constitute virtual currency, real currency, or any form of property outside of the Services. The price of Tokens may vary depending on the bundle size purchased, but the Token cost of Premium Services is determined solely by us and will be clearly indicated before you proceed. We reserve the right to change the pricing of Token bundles and the Token cost of Premium Services at any time, in our sole discretion.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.4. Usage:</strong> Tokens are deducted from your Account balance when you successfully access or use a Premium Service, such as after a Report is successfully generated in the Car Inspector application. Once Tokens are used for a Premium Service, they are generally non-refundable and non-reversible.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.5. Expiration & Service Discontinuation:</strong> Tokens purchased from us do not expire based on time or usage, provided the Services remain operational. However, you acknowledge and agree that if the BuiltThis Software Services are discontinued or shut down, any remaining Tokens in your Account will be lost without refund. We will endeavour to provide reasonable notice if we plan to discontinue the Services, but this may not always be possible.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.6. Refunds:</strong> Except where required by applicable UK law (including statutory consumer rights), purchases of Tokens are final and non-refundable in monetary value. Tokens have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash. Notwithstanding this, at our sole discretion, we may provide a refund in Tokens (by adding Tokens back to your Account balance) if there are significant technical issues with the platform or errors in the content directly caused by our software that prevented the successful delivery or accurate generation of a Premium Service you attempted to access.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.7. Non-Transferable:</strong> Tokens are linked to your specific Account and cannot be transferred to or shared with other users or accounts.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>3.8. Account Termination/Suspension:</strong> If your Account is terminated or suspended by us due to a breach of these Terms, any remaining Tokens in your Account will be forfeited without refund. If you terminate your Account, any remaining Tokens will also be forfeited without refund.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827;">4. Nature of Services & Liability for Reports (Car Inspector)</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>4.1.</strong> The Car Inspector application and the Reports it generates are intended as informational guides only. The step-by-step process and the resulting Report are designed to assist you in conducting your own vehicle inspection and help inform your purchase decision.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>4.2.</strong> The Report is NOT a substitute for a professional mechanical inspection. It relies solely on the information you input and is based on general guidance, not specific expert knowledge of the particular vehicle's history, condition, or potential hidden faults.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>4.3.</strong> We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information contained in the Report or the outcome of following the inspection guide. Vehicle condition can vary significantly, and important issues may not be detectable through the guided process or apparent at the time of inspection.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>4.4. Limitation of Liability regarding Vehicle Purchase:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that any decision to purchase a vehicle based, in whole or in part, on the use of the Car Inspector application or its Report is made by you solely at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable UK law, we shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense whatsoever arising from or in connection with your decision to purchase (or not to purchase) a vehicle, or any issues, faults, or problems discovered with a vehicle after your inspection or purchase, regardless of whether you used our Services to guide your decision.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <strong>4.5.</strong> Our responsibility under UK consumer law is limited to providing the Car Inspector service itself with reasonable care and skill, ensuring it is of satisfactory quality and fit for its intended purpose as a guide and tool, not as a guarantee of a vehicle's condition or value.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">
